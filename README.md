CALC (formerly known as "Hourglass"), which stands for Contracts Awarded Labor Category, is a tool to help contracting personnel estimate their per-hour labor costs for a contract, based on historical pricing information. The tool is live at [https://calc.gsa.gov](https://calc.gsa.gov). You can track our progress on our [trello board](https://trello.com/b/LjXJaVbZ/prices) or file an issue on this repo.
